The objective of this project is to investigate the relationships between various attributes of songs and identify the key features that effectively differentiate between genres. Given that the dataset lacks explicit genre labels, we will employ unsupervised learning methods, specifically clustering algorithms, to organize the songs into distinct groups. These groups, formed based on similarities in their musical attributes, will serve as proxies for genres. Through this approach, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns in the data that signal genre distinctions, despite the absence of pre-defined genre classifications.
